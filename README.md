# Forecasting India's COâ‚‚ Emissions (1960â€“2045) Using Facebook Prophet

This notebook demonstrates how to use Facebook's [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) model to forecast India's COâ‚‚ emissions over the next 30 years based on historical data from 1960 to 2019.

---

### Objective

- Understand India's historical carbon emission trends
- Use time-series forecasting (Prophet) to predict future COâ‚‚ emissions
- Visualize and interpret results for climate awareness and policy insights

---

###  Dataset

- **Source**: [Our World in Data â€“ COâ‚‚ Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
- **Time Period Used**: 1960 to 2019
- **Columns Used**:
  - `Entity` â†’ renamed to `country`
  - `Annual COâ‚‚ emissions (tonnes )` â†’ renamed to `co2`
  - `Year` â†’ renamed to `ds` for Prophet compatibility
- **Filtered**: Only India, and years from 1960 onwards

---

###  Model: Facebook Prophet

- Prophet is robust to missing data and trend changes.
- Automatically detects trend shifts and forecasts with uncertainty intervals.
- Excellent for time series like this with long-term growth.

---

###  Forecast Overview

- Trained the model on COâ‚‚ emissions data from 1960â€“2019
- Forecasted emissions from 2020 to 2045
- Confidence intervals (yhat_lower, yhat_upper) included for uncertainty

---

###  Key Insights

- India's emissions were low until 1980, after which exponential growth began.
- The model projects continued growth in COâ‚‚ emissions if trends remain unchanged.
- **Forecast for 2030**: Approximately 3.1 billion tonnes of COâ‚‚ (Â± confidence margin).
- This highlights the **urgency of sustainable development and clean energy adoption**.

---

### Conclusion

This notebook provides a simple yet powerful approach to forecasting emissions using Prophet. It can help policymakers, researchers, and the public understand the trajectory of emissions and the need for intervention.

---

### Future Work

- Compare results with ARIMA, LSTM, or other deep learning models.
- Add external regressors like GDP, population, energy mix, or policies.
- Explore forecasting for other countries or per capita emissions.
